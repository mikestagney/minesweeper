# Minesweeper
Command line version of the classic Minesweeper game

## Things learned

Recursive function used to uncover the free and numbered cells

Regular expressions used to valid user input

### Details

#### The directory contains 3 files:

* Main.java - creates GameController object and starts runGame method
* Controller.java - create board object, handles user input and runs the main game loop
* Board.java - keeps track of game state and contains methods to handle user choices

Seventeenth project created for JetBrains Academy Java Developer course - medium level project.

### How to Play

User selects how many mines they want on the board.

On a 9 X 9 grid, the player selects a cell, typing 1 - 9 for the column and row.

The first cell selected will never contain a mine. Mines are then added at random.

The player can either flag the cell for a mine or uncover it.

To win, all the mines are flagged or all free cells are uncovered.

The player loses if a mine is uncovered.

The input syntax is:

> 3 5 open

(uncover cell at column 3, row 5)

> 6 4 flag

(flag cell at column 6, row 4)

The following symbols represent each cell's state:

* . for covered cells

* An empty space for uncovered free cells without mines around it

* Numbers from 1 to 8 for uncovered free cells with 1 to 8 mines around them

* X for mines (only displayed if the player has uncovered a mine)

* \* for uncovered flagged cells

## Sample input and output:

### Example \#1: user wins by opening all safe cells
